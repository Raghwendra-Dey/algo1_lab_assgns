# algo1_lab_assgns
Repo for the assignments of the algorithms 1 lab and my solutions for them.<br>
## Naming Scheme:
Files with some number in front of them are the solutions of previous years assingments.<br>
The number following the `t` is the number of the `assignment` or `task` and the number following that(after underscore) is the `problem number` in that `assignment`.<br/>
you could find the assignments in [this page](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~abhij/course/lab/Algo1/Spring20/). **Also the status of each code is written on the top of each file.**

Feel free to use these wherever you want :)
### **No responsibility for the correctness of the solutions whatsoever**
