# algo1_lab_assgns
Repo for the assignments of the algorithms 1 lab and my solutions for them.<br>
## Naming Scheme:
Files with some number in front of them are the solutions of previous years assingments.<br>
The number following the `t` is the number of the `assignment` or `task` and the number following that is the `problem number` in that `assignment`.

Feel free to use these wherever you want :)
### **No responsibility for the correctness of the solutions whatsoever**
